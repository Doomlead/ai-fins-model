## Credits

- [@jam1garner](https://github.com/jam1garner), whose [Smash-Forge](https://github.com/jam1garner/Smash-Forge) tool was referenced to add support for Melee models.
- [@Ploaj](https://github.com/Ploaj), whose [HSDLib](https://github.com/Ploaj/HSDLib) library was heavily referenced to fix the Super Smash Bros. Melee .dat importer (since HSDLib has nearly perfect accuracy!!).
- [@revel8n](https://github.com/revel8n), whose [Smashboards thread](https://smashboards.com/threads/melee-dat-format.292603/) was referenced to add support for the .dat importer.
