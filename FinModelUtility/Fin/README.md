# Fin

Common library that defines a number of utilities, such as generating/converting models, working with OpenGL, reading/writing files, working with file systems, etc. 

I've written many such libraries in the past, ideally this will be the ***Fin***al time I have to write one.

- [@leftp](https://github.com/leftp), whose [SharpDirLister](https://github.com/EncodeGroup/SharpDirLister) API was used to dramatically improve listing out the file hierarchy.
- [@LuizZak](https://github.com/LuizZak), whose [FastBitmap](https://github.com/LuizZak/FastBitmap) library was used to optimize working with bitmaps and inspired some optimizations in Fin's image processing methods.
